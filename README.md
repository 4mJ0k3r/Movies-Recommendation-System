## Movie Recommendation System

### Overview
The provided code implements a movie recommendation system using Python. The system utilizes the pandas and numpy libraries for data processing, and the scikit-learn library for feature extraction and similarity calculations. The recommendation system is based on the concept of cosine similarity between movie tags, which are derived from various attributes of the movies such as overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

### Data Processing and Feature Extraction
The code begins by loading two datasets, 'tmdb_5000_movies.csv' and 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv', and merging them based on the movie title. It then selects specific columns and applies functions to extract and process relevant information such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew from the dataset. Additionally, the code combines the extracted information into a single list of tags and applies stemming to the tags. Finally, it performs vectorization of the tags using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.

### Cosine Similarity Calculation
After vectorization, the code calculates the cosine similarity between the movie tags using the cosine_similarity function from scikit-learn. This similarity matrix is then used to recommend the top 5 movies based on the cosine similarity with a given movie.

### Saving the Model
The code concludes by saving the processed data and the similarity matrix into pickle files for future use.

### Recommendations for GitHub README
The GitHub README file for this recommendation system should include the following sections:
1. **Introduction:** Briefly explain the purpose and functionality of the recommendation system.
2. **Data Processing:** Describe the data processing steps, including merging datasets, extracting and processing movie attributes, and vectorization of tags.
3. **Cosine Similarity Calculation:** Explain the calculation of cosine similarity and its role in generating movie recommendations.
4. **Usage:** Provide instructions on how to use the recommendation system, including loading the saved model and making movie recommendations.
5. **Dependencies:** List the required libraries and dependencies for running the recommendation system.
6. **Example:** Include an example code snippet demonstrating how to use the recommendation system to generate movie recommendations.

The README should be clear, concise, and well-organized to help users understand and utilize the recommendation system effectively.
